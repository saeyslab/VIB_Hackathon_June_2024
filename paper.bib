  abstract     = {We present ilastik, an easy-to-use interactive tool that brings machine-learning-based (bio)image analysis to end users without substantial computational expertise. It contains pre-defined workflows for image segmentation, object classification, counting and tracking. Users adapt the workflows to the problem at hand by interactively providing sparse training annotations for a nonlinear classifier. ilastik can process data in up to five dimensions (3D, time and number of channels). Its computational back end runs operations on-demand wherever possible, allowing for interactive prediction on data larger than {RAM}. Once the classifiers are trained, ilastik workflows can be applied to new data from the command line without further user interaction. We describe all ilastik workflows in detail, including three case studies and a discussion on the expected performance.},

Transcriptomics provides rich information to infer cell–cell interactions and communication, thus accelerating the discovery of the roles of cells within their communities. Such research relies heavily on algorithms that infer which cells are interacting and the ligands and receptors involved. Specific pressures on different research niches are driving the evolution of next-generation computational tools, enabling new conceptual opportunities and technological advances. More sophisticated algorithms now account for the heterogeneity and spatial organization of cells, multiple ligand types and intracellular signalling events, and enable the use of larger and more complex datasets, including single-cell and spatial transcriptomics. Similarly, new high-throughput experimental methods are increasing the number and resolution of interactions that can be analysed simultaneously. Here, we explore recent progress in cell–cell interaction research and highlight the diversification of the next generation of tools, which have yielded a rich ecosystem of tools for different applications and are enabling invaluable discoveries.},

A collective optimal transport method is developed to handle complex molecular interactions and spatial constraints. Furthermore, we introduce downstream analysis tools to infer spatial signaling directionality and genes regulated by signaling using machine learning models. We apply {COMMOT} to simulation data and eight spatial datasets acquired with five different technologies to show its effectiveness and robustness in identifying spatial {CCC} in data with varying spatial resolutions and gene coverages.

  abstract  = {Recent advances in spatial omics methods are revolutionising biomedical research by enabling detailed molecular analyses of cells and their interactions in their native state. As most technologies capture only a specific type of molecules, there is an unmet need to enable integration of multiple spatial-omics datasets. This, however, presents several challenges as these analyses typically operate on separate tissue sections at disparate spatial resolutions. Here, we established a spatial multi-omics integration pipeline enabling co-registration and granularity matching, and applied it to integrate spatial transcriptomics, mass spectrometry-based lipidomics, single nucleus {RNA}-seq and histomorphological information from human prostate cancer patient samples. This approach revealed unique correlations between lipids and gene expression profiles that are linked to distinct cell populations and histopathological disease states and uncovered molecularly different subregions not discernible by morphology alone. By its ability to correlate datasets that span across the biomolecular and spatial scale, the application of this novel spatial multi-omics integration pipeline provides unprecedented insight into the intricate interplay between different classes of molecules in a tissue context. In addition, it has unique hypothesis-generating potential, and holds promise for applications in molecular pathology, biomarker and target discovery and other tissue-based research fields.},

Here, we enumerate multiple parameters of interest that should be considered in the design of a properly powered spatial omics study. We introduce a method for tunable in silico tissue ({IST}) generation and use it with spatial profiling data sets to construct an exploratory computational framework for spatial power analysis.

We address these challenges by representing spatial transcriptomics data as generalized functions encoding position and high-dimensional feature (gene, cell type) identity. We map onto low-dimensional atlas ontologies by modeling regions as homogeneous random fields with unknown transcriptomic feature distribution. We solve simultaneously for the minimizing geodesic diffeomorphism of coordinates through {LDDMM} and for these latent feature densities. We map tissue-scale mouse brain atlases to gene-based and cell-based transcriptomics data from {MERFISH} and {BARseq} technologies and to histopathology and cross-species atlases to illustrate integration of diverse molecular and cellular datasets into a single coordinate system as a means of comparison and further atlas construction.},

  abstract  = {Colorectal cancer ({CRC}) is the second-deadliest cancer in the world, yet a deeper understanding of spatial patterns of gene expression in the tumor microenvironment ({TME}) remains elusive. Here, we introduce the Visium {HD} platform (10x Genomics) and use it to investigate human {CRC} and normal adjacent mucosal tissues from formalin fixed paraffin embedded ({FFPE}) samples. The first assay available on Visium {HD} is a probe-based spatial transcriptomics workflow that was developed to enable whole transcriptome single cell scale analysis. We demonstrate highly refined unsupervised spatial clustering in Visium {HD} data that aligns with the hallmarks of colon tissue morphology and is notably improved over earlier Visium assays. Using serial sections from the same {FFPE} blocks we generate a single cell atlas of our samples, then we integrate the data to comprehensively characterize the immune cell types present in the {TME}, specifically at the tumor periphery. We observed enrichment of two pro-tumor macrophage subpopulations with differential gene expression profiles that were localized within distinct tumor regions. Further characterization of the T cells present in one of the samples revealed a clonal expansion that we were able to localize in the tissue using in situ gene expression analysis. In situ analysis also allowed us to perform in-depth characterization of the microenvironment of the clonally expanded T cell population and we identified a third macrophage subpopulation with gene expression profiles consistent with an anti-tumor response. Our study provides a comprehensive map of the cellular composition of the {CRC} {TME} and identifies phenotypically and spatially distinct immune cell populations within it. We show that the single cell-scale resolution afforded by Visium {HD} and the whole transcriptome nature of the assay allows investigations into cellular function and interaction at the tumor periphery in {FFPE} tissues, which has not been previously possible.},

  abstract   = {Each cell type in a solid tissue has a characteristic transcriptome and spatial arrangement, both of which are observable using modern spatial omics assays. However, the common practice is still to ignore spatial information when clustering cells to identify cell types. In fact, spatial location is typically considered only when solving the related, but distinct, problem of demarcating tissue domains (which could include multiple cell types). We present {BANKSY}, an algorithm that unifies cell type clustering and domain segmentation by constructing a product space of cell and neighbourhood transcriptomes, representing cell state and microenvironment, respectively. {BANKSY}’s spatial kernel-based feature augmentation strategy improves per-formance and scalability on both tasks when tested on {FISH}-based and sequencing-based spatial omics data. Uniquely, {BANKSY} identified hitherto undetected niche-dependent cell states in two mouse brain regions. Lastly, we show that quality control of spatial omics data can be formulated as a domain identification problem and solved using {BANKSY}. {BANKSY} represents a biologically motivated, scalable, and versatile framework for analyzing spatial omics data.},
